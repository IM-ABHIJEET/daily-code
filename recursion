what is recursion?
==>> Function calls it self....
     The Process in which the function call itslef directly or indirectly is called as Recursion. And the Function is called as Recursive Function.

notes- when a big or complex problem depends upon a same type or/and small problem then the recorsion can be used.
eg- 2^5=2*2*2*2*2 &
    2^5=2*2^4 || 2^4=2*2^3 || 2^3=2*2^2 || 2^2=2*2
